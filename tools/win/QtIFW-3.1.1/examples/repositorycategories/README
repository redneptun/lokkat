Shows how to set up an online installer and how to use categorized repositories. Categorized repositories are not loaded to the tree view by default, instead you can select
to show categorized repositories in a tree view combobox. By default, repositories without categories are always shown in the tree view.

The example uses a very simple web server shipped with Python.

Generate the online repositories with

  repogen -p packages repository
  repogen -p packages_forcategory1 repository1
  repogen -p packages2_forcategory1 repository2
  repogen -p packages_forcategory2 repository3

Generate the installer with

  binarycreator --online-only -c config/config.xml -p packages installer

Now launch a minimal web server in the example's directory (admin rights may be needed)

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

This should make the content of the local directory available under
http://localhost

You should be able to now launch the installer.

To deploy an update, run

  repogen --update-new-components -p packages_update repository

and launch the maintenance tool in your installation.
