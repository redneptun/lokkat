    \title Translation Example

    \brief Using translations to localize installer pages and licenses.

    \image qtifw-examples-translations.png

    \e{Translations} illustrates how to use translations to localize the output
    of component scripts and component UI files into another language. It also shows
    how to select the license according to the system language.

    To add a new language, you first need to create a translation source (TS) file for
    the package that contains all the translatable strings. Run the following command in
    the package's meta directory:

    \code
       lupdate installscript.qs page.ui -ts <language>.ts
    \endcode

    Replace <language> with the two letter lowercase code for the language you want to
    translate to. After finishing translating you need to use lrelease on that
    TS file to generate the binary Qt messages (QM) file. Do not forget to include
    that in the package.xml as shown below. Run the following command in
    the package's meta directory:

    \code
       lrelase <language>.ts
    \endcode


    \include installerfw-examples-configuring.qdocinc

    \quotefile translations/config/config.xml

    \include installerfw-examples-packaging.qdocinc

    \list
        \li The \c <Default> element is set to \c true to preselect the
            component in the installer.
        \li The \c <Script> element specifies the file name of the JavaScript
            file that is loaded to perform operations.
        \li The \c <License> element specifies the file name of the license file
            that is shown when this component is selected for installation.
        \li The \c <Translations> element specifies the file name of the QM
            file containing translations for this compontent's UI and script files.
    \endlist
